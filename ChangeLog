Version 0.7.3 (12-11-2003)
+ alexeictrl_client now updated for network code. Or at least it was, until...
+ changed alexei_connect() to accept a hostname.
+ There's a new define for alexeictrl_server. define NOPP to compile a version
  that prints the parport bits to stdout instead of actually flipping bits on
  an actual parport. Useful for those without a parport (or root access).

Version 0.7.2 (12-5-2003)
+ Made alexeictrl_server.
+ PWM code works for left motor!
- Removed weaponFire from botstate/botpacket, and grab is now grabOrFire.
+ Added more to network test program to better test PWM.
+ Created parallel port test program which goes Knight Rider style on the
  parallel port data pins.

Version 0.7.1 (12-1-2003)
+ Added network capability to libalexeictrl, with corresponding test program
- removed autoconf/automake trash. run ./bootstrap.sh to regenerate the
  autoconf/automake system.

Version 0.7.0 (11-7-2003)
+ Changed over to autoconf/automake. Things are now slightly more portable, and
  easier to deal with.
+ Created libalexeictrl, and moved the botcmd struct into it (renamed to
  botstate). Created botpacket struct, functions to convert between botstate
  and botpacket, and debug printing routines.
+ Created basic test program for testing conversion of botcmd and botstruct
